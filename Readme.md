9-levels Reversed Voltage (RV) topology Transformerless GTI is designed in MATLAB/Simulink with reduced number of switches, 
design of filter to effectively reduce the ripple component injected into the grid to an acceptable value and reduce the Total Harmonics Distortions (THD). 
Through PLL synchronization of inverter is achieved to that of reference grid. 
The focus is on design of pure sine wave inverter, which will synchronize with grid in minimum possible time and able to feed surplus power toward the grid.
